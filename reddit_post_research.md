# Beyond Black Box AI: Logic Primitives & MCP Servers for Transparent Research [r/Research]

While we can all agree AI research tools aren't where they need to be yet (looking at you, phantom citations), I wanted to share a framework that's dramatically improved my research process: **Logic Primitives with MCP servers**.

## The Problem with Current AI Research Tools

Most of us have hit these frustrations:

* **Perplexity/ChatGPT/Claude** generate conclusions with no visible reasoning
* **Citations appear out of nowhere** with no verification
* **Every conclusion has the same confidence level** (usually 100% certain!)
* **Research process is opaque** and can't be audited or reproduced

## Logic Primitives: Breaking Research into Cognitive Building Blocks

The key innovation: treating research as a series of **distinct cognitive operations** rather than one black box.

```
observe → define → distinguish → infer → reflect → synthesize → decide → adapt
```

Each step:
1. Uses a specialized prompt template
2. Produces a documented artifact with metadata
3. Makes reasoning explicit and auditable

## How Logic Primitives Transform Real Research

**Traditional AI approach:**
```
User: "Analyze how AI will impact elections in 2026"

[Black box processing]

AI: "AI will impact elections through deepfakes, etc... Experts suggest..." 
[With unverifiable sources and opaque reasoning]
```

**With Logic Primitives:**
1. **Observe**: Collect raw data without interpretation
2. **Define**: Create explicit framework with clear dimensions
3. **Distinguish**: Categorize technologies by impact type
4. **Infer**: Generate conclusions with explicit confidence ratings
5. **Reflect**: Evaluate methodological limitations
6. **Synthesize**: Integrate findings with clear source trails

## Implementing with MCP Servers (The Technical Part)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are the infrastructure that makes this possible:

1. **logic-mcp-primitives**: Core thinking operations
   - `observe`, `define`, `infer`, etc.

2. **Search & data servers**:
   - `brave-search`: Web search with structured results
   - `arxiv-mcp`: Academic paper retrieval
   - `perplexity`: Enhanced search capabilities

3. **Domain-specific servers**:
   - `alphavantage-mcp`: Financial data
   - `context7`: Technical documentation

## Getting Started Without IDE Complexities

You don't need complex IDE setups to start using this approach:

1. **Structural implementation with markdown files:**
   - Create a directory structure for your research:
   ```
   /research_project/
   ├── raw/observations/       # Raw data collected
   ├── analysis/frameworks/    # Your defined frameworks
   ├── analysis/inferences/    # Your reasoning steps
   └── synthesis/              # Final integration
   ```

2. **Start with basic templates:**
   - For observations:
   ```markdown
   # OBSERVE: [Topic]
   
   ## Raw Observed Data
   1. [Data point 1]
      - Source: [Verifiable source]
      - Confidence: [Confidence level]
   2. [Data point 2]
      ...
   
   ## Metadata
   - Observation ID: obs_[unique_id]
   - Context ID: [research_context]
   - Timestamp: [date_time]
   ```

3. **Implement process patterns for common research tasks:**
   - **Trend analysis**: observe → sequence → compare → infer
   - **Hypothesis testing**: observe → ask → infer → reflect → adapt
   - **Decision making**: observe → compare → infer → decide

## Basic Implementation (No Server Required)

Even without setting up MCP servers, you can start using this approach:

1. Create template markdown files for each primitive
2. Document each step of your research process explicitly
3. Maintain clear source attribution and confidence levels
4. Use the file structure to enforce methodological discipline

## For Those Who Want Technical Implementation

If you're comfortable with Node.js:

1. Set up a basic server with:
   ```bash
   mkdir logic-mcp-primitives
   cd logic-mcp-primitives
   npm init -y
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @google/generative-ai sqlite
   ```

2. Create handlers for core operations and a database for state persistence

3. Connect to any AI model of your choice (the repo uses Gemini)

## Why This Beats Traditional AI Research

* **Traceable reasoning chains** from evidence to conclusions
* **Variable confidence levels** based on source quality
* **Explicit frameworks** that stay consistent
* **Bias identification** through reflection steps
* **Reproducible methodology** through structured artifacts

## Where to Learn More

I've found the [LogicPrimitives repository](https://github.com/Mnehmos/LogicPrimatives-VarioResearch-Mnehmos) helpful in setting this up - it has conceptual guides and documentation (though not installable software yet).

Has anyone else experimented with structured reasoning frameworks for AI research? How are you dealing with the limitations of current tools?
