# Multi-Agent Architecture

This document details the specialized agent architecture that powers the LogicPrimitives framework, explaining how different agents collaborate to produce superior research outcomes.

## Overview: Why Multiple Agents?

Traditional AI research tools use a generalist approach where a single model attempts to handle all aspects of a complex task. The LogicPrimitives framework instead uses a multi-agent architecture, where:

1. Each agent specializes in specific cognitive tasks
2. Agents communicate through standardized protocols
3. Work is coordinated by an orchestration layer
4. Each agent maintains accountability for its output

This specialization enables more reliable, transparent, and higher-quality research results.

## Agent Types and Responsibilities

### Orchestrator Agent

## Communication Pattern: Boomerang Logic

The multi-agent system uses a "boomerang logic" communication pattern:

1. **Orchestrator Assignment**: Tasks originate from the Orchestrator with clear parameters
2. **Specialist Processing**: A specialist agent processes the task according to its expertise
3. **Structured Return**: Results return to the Orchestrator in a standardized format
4. **Quality Verification**: The Orchestrator verifies the result meets requirements
5. **Integration or Refinement**: The result is either integrated or sent back for refinement

This pattern ensures:
- Clear accountability for each research component
- Consistent quality standards across all work
- Transparent task boundaries and ownership
- Effective dependency management

### Boomerang Payload Example

```json
{
  "task_id": "quantum_timeline_research_001",
  "origin_mode": "Orchestrator",
  "destination_mode": "Research",
  "status": "assigned",
  "parameters": {
    "topic": "Quantum computing timeline projections",
    "focus": "Financial cryptography implications",
    "timeframe": "2025-2035",
    "required_outputs": [
      "Expert consensus summary",
      "Key milestone timeline",
      "Confidence assessment"
    ]
  }
}
```

Return payload:
```json
{
  "task_id": "quantum_timeline_research_001",
  "origin_mode": "Research",
  "destination_mode": "Orchestrator",
  "status": "complete",
  "result": "Completed timeline analysis in research/quantum_timeline_analysis.md",
  "metadata": {
    "sources": 14,
    "confidence_level": "medium-high",
    "completion_time": "2025-04-29T09:15:32Z"
  }
}
```

## Agent Configuration

Each agent is configured with specialized parameters:

### Role Definition

```yaml
role_definition:
  mode_name: Research
  identity: >
    You are the investigation specialist focused on gathering reliable, 
    traceable evidence through systematic research...
  core_competencies:
    - Evidence triangulation across diverse sources
    - Pattern recognition in complex data
    - Source quality evaluation
    - Synthesis of competing viewpoints
```

### Process Guidelines

```yaml
process_guidelines:
  - Phase 1: Initial exploration using observe primitive
  - Phase 2: Source evaluation using compare primitive
  - Phase 3: Pattern identification using distinguish primitive
  - Phase 4: Gap analysis using reflect primitive
  - Phase 5: Comprehensive synthesis
```

### Communication Protocols

```yaml
communication_protocols:
  - Documentation standards
    - All sources cited with reliability assessment
    - Clear differentiation between observation and inference
    - Explicit confidence levels for all conclusions
  - Output formats
    - Standardized Markdown structure
    - Machine-readable metadata
    - Timestamped processing logs
```

## Implementing a Multi-Agent System

While this repository provides conceptual documentation rather than implementation code, the principles of a multi-agent system can be applied by:

1. Creating clear role definitions for each agent type
2. Establishing standard communication protocols between agents
3. Implementing a tracking system for task status and dependencies
4. Maintaining consistent documentation standards across all agents
5. Developing verification procedures for quality control

This structured approach ensures that the collective intelligence of specialized agents produces research that is more reliable, transparent, and high-quality than generalist one-shot generation.
