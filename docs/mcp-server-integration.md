# MCP Server Integration

This document explains how the LogicPrimitives framework conceptually integrates with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers to extend its capabilities.

## What are MCP Servers?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers are specialized services that provide additional tools and resources to AI models through a standardized protocol. They enable:

1. **Extended Capabilities**: Access to functions beyond the AI's native capabilities
2. **External Data Access**: Retrieval of information from specialized sources
3. **Standardized Communication**: Consistent interaction patterns through defined schemas
4. **Modular Design**: The ability to add new capabilities as needed

## Core MCP Servers in LogicPrimitives

### 1. logic-mcp-primitives

This foundational server implements the core cognitive primitives that power the framework.

**Key Tools:**
- `observe`: Perceives input without distortion
- `define`: Establishes identity, boundaries, and core attributes
- `distinguish`: Identifies differences between inputs
- `sequence`: Places items in logical, causal, or temporal order
- `compare`: Evaluates items based on criteria
- `infer`: Generates conclusions from evidence
- `reflect`: Questions assumptions and identifies gaps
- `synthesize`: Merges multiple pieces of information into a coherent whole
- `decide`: Commits to a path based on analysis
- `adapt`: Modifies plans based on new information

**Integration Pattern:**
```
context_id = "research_topic_123"
observation = logic_mcp.observe(
  context_id=context_id,
  source="Raw data about the topic"
)
```

### 2. brave-search

Provides access to web search capabilities for research.

**Key Tools:**
- `brave_web_search`: General web search across diverse sources
- `brave_local_search`: Location-based search for physical businesses and services

**Integration Pattern:**
```
search_results = brave_search.brave_web_search(
  query="Latest developments in quantum computing",
  count=10
)
```

### 3. perplexity

Offers enhanced search with analytical capabilities.

**Key Tools:**
- `search`: AI-enhanced web search with synthesis
- `fact_check`: Verification of statements with sources
- `code_assistant`: Code-specific generation and analysis

**Integration Pattern:**
```
verified_information = perplexity.fact_check(
  statement="Quantum computers achieved supremacy in 2019"
)
```

### 4. arxiv-mcp

Provides access to scientific papers and academic research.

**Key Tools:**
- `search_papers`: Find papers by various criteria
- `get_paper`: Retrieve details about a specific paper
- `get_paper_content`: Extract text from papers

**Integration Pattern:**
```
quantum_papers = arxiv_mcp.search_papers(
  query="quantum error correction",
  category="quant-ph",
  max_results=5
)
```

### 5. alphavantage-mcp

Delivers financial and market data for economic research.

**Key Tools:**
- `get_equity_quote`: Real-time stock data
- `technical_indicators`: Technical analysis tools
- `fundamental_data`: Company financial statements
- `economic_indicators`: Macroeconomic data points

**Integration Pattern:**
```
stock_data = alphavantage_mcp.get_equity_quote(
  symbol="AAPL"
)
```

### 6. context7

Provides specialized documentation lookup for technical references.

**Key Tools:**
- `resolve-library-id`: Find documentation for a library
- `get-library-docs`: Retrieve documentation

**Integration Pattern:**
```
library_id = context7.resolve_library_id(
  libraryName="React"
)
react_docs = context7.get_library_docs(
  context7CompatibleLibraryID=library_id,
  topic="hooks"
)
```

## Integration Workflow

LogicPrimitives connects to these MCP servers in a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection Phase**
   - Logic primitives define the information needed
   - Specialized MCP servers retrieve relevant data
   - Results are stored with source attribution

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Logic primitives process the collected data
   - Each step in the analysis is documented
   - Confidence levels are assigned based on data quality

3. **Synthesis Phase**
   - Multiple data sources are integrated
   - Conflicting information is reconciled
   - Final analysis maintains links to original sources

## MCP Server Communication

Although this is a conceptual framework, the communication with MCP servers would follow this pattern:

```json
{
  "server_name": "logic-mcp-primitives",
  "tool_name": "observe",
  "arguments": {
    "context_id": "research_project_123",
    "source": "Raw data to observe",
    "format": "text"
  }
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "observation_id": "obs_abc123def456",
  "context_id": "research_project_123",
  "observed_data": "Processed observation of the raw data",
  "metadata": {
    "source": "Original source information",
    "format": "text",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-29T08:42:50.108Z"
  }
}
```

## Source Documentation

A key strength of the LogicPrimitives framework is its rigorous source documentation. For each external data source:

- **Origin**: Which MCP server provided the data
- **Query**: What specific query generated the data
- **Timestamp**: When the data was retrieved
- **Confidence**: Assessment of the source's reliability
- **Relationship**: How this data relates to other sources

## Implementing Your Own MCP Server Concept

To extend the LogicPrimitives framework with new capabilities:

1. Define the server's purpose and unique value
2. Design the tool interfaces with clear input/output schemas
3. Document how the server integrates with the existing primitives
4. Provide examples of how the server enhances research quality

## Example: Research Flow with MCP Integration

For a research question on "Impact of quantum computing on cryptography by 2030":

1. **Initial Data Collection**:
   ```
   brave_search.brave_web_search("quantum computing cryptography impact")
   arxiv_mcp.search_papers(category="quant-ph", query="post-quantum cryptography")
   ```

2. **Framework Definition**:
   ```
   logic_mcp.define(
     context_id="quantum_crypto_research",
     target_id=observation.id,
     name="Quantum Cryptography Impact Framework",
     boundaries="Focus on encryption standards used in financial systems",
     core_attributes="Timeframe, vulnerability metrics, adoption patterns"
   )
   ```

3. **Analysis and Synthesis**:
   ```
   logic_mcp.synthesize(
     context_id="quantum_crypto_research",
     input_ids=[observation.id, framework.id, distinction.id, inference.id],
     synthesis_goal="create_comprehensive_impact_assessment"
   )
   ```

This integration of specialized data sources with structured cognitive operations produces research that is both comprehensive and transparent.
