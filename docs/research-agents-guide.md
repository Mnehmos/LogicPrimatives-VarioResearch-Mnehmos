# Research Reinvented: Building Your Own AI Research Team with Logic Primitives

After experimenting with conventional AI tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT, Brave Search, and Claude for research, I've developed a superior approach using specialized agents and logic primitives. This guide will show you how to build your own AI research team that produces dramatically better results than one-shot generation.

## Why Your Current AI Research Tools Are Failing You

If you regularly use AI for research, you've likely encountered these frustrations:

| Mainstream Tool | Critical Limitations |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Perplexity** | • Auto-generates unverifiable citations<br>• Black box reasoning with no audit trail<br>• Inconsistent methodology application |
| **ChatGPT** | • Context limitation restricts deep analysis<br>• No source verification capabilities<br>• Single-agent bottlenecks damage complex reasoning |
| **Claude** | • Context window constraints<br>• Limited workspace integration<br>• One-shot generation without verification |
| **Brave AI** | • Focus on search without synthesis<br>• Lacks structured metadata for research artifacts<br>• No analytical framework consistency |

These limitations stem from a fundamental design flaw: **treating complex research as a single undifferentiated task** rather than a series of distinct cognitive operations.

## The Logic Primitives Revolution: Modular Research Operations

The key insight is breaking research into fundamental cognitive operations connected through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:

```
observe → define → distinguish → sequence → compare → infer → reflect → ask → synthesize → decide → adapt
```

Each operation becomes a **separate, documented function** with its own prompt template, producing a distinct artifact with clear metadata and traceable origins.

## How Logic Primitives Transform Research: A Practical Example

To illustrate the difference, let's examine how the Logic Primitives approach handles research on AI's impact on democratic elections in 2026:

### Traditional AI Approach
```
User: "Analyze how AI will impact democratic elections in 2026"

[Black box processing]

AI: "AI will impact elections through deepfakes, disinformation campaigns,
and personalized persuasion. Experts suggest implementation of media literacy programs..."
[Unverifiable sources, opaque reasoning process, inconsistent framework]
```

### Logic Primitives Approach

**1. Observe:** Collect raw information without interpretation
```markdown
# OBSERVE: AI Election Impact 2026

AI technologies potentially impacting democratic elections in 2026 include:

1. Deepfakes and synthetic media capable of creating realistic fake videos/audio
   - Source: Chesney & Citron (2024), "Deep Fakes and Elections"
   - Confidence: High (multiple verified implementations exist)

2. Automated disinformation campaigns at scale
   - Source: NATO StratCom Report (2024), "Computational Propaganda Trends"
   - Confidence: High (documented in 2020-2024 elections)

...
```

**2. Define:** Establish clear framework dimensions
```markdown
# DEFINE: AI Election Impact Framework

Framework axes:
1. Threat/Safeguard axis
   - Definition: Classifies whether an AI application threatens or protects election integrity
   - Boundary: Only includes applications with direct electoral impact

2. Information/Infrastructure axis
   - Definition: Distinguishes between effects on information ecosystem vs. electoral systems
   - Boundary: Excludes general public opinion effects without specific electoral context

...
```

**3. Distinguish:** Identify meaningful differences
```markdown
# DISTINGUISH: AI Threat Categories

| Category | Key Characteristics | Examples | Detection Difficulty |
|----------|--------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| Synthetic Media | Visual/audio fakery, identity manipulation | Deepfakes of candidates, synthetic voice calls | Medium-High |
| Algorithmic Manipulation | Exploitation of platform algorithms | Coordinated inauthentic behavior, trend hijacking | High |
...
```

**4. Synthesize:** (After additional steps)
```markdown
# SYNTHESIZE: AI Election Impact Analysis

## Information Ecosystem Threats & Safeguards

| Threat | Impact | Safeguard | Effectiveness |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Deepfakes | HIGH - Creates false narratives with high believability | AI detection systems | MEDIUM - Detection lags generation capacity |
...

## Strategic Recommendations
1. Technical-Regulatory Hybrid Approach
   - Reasoning: Technical solutions alone insufficient due to detection lag
   - Evidence: Princeton study showing 37% detection failure rate
   - Confidence: High (multiple expert sources agree)
...
```

Each step produces an auditable artifact with explicit sources, confidence levels, and reasoning chains. The final synthesis combines these into a comprehensive analysis that is far more reliable than one-shot generation.

## Building Your Research Team: Specialized Agents with Clear Roles

To implement this approach, you'll need a team of specialized agents:

### 1. Orchestrator Agent
**Primary Role:** Task decomposition, assignment, and verification

Responsibilities:
- Breaking complex research questions into atomic subtasks
- Assigning subtasks to appropriate specialist agents
- Tracking progress and dependencies
- Verifying subtask completeness and quality

### 2. Research Agent
**Primary Role:** Information gathering and synthesis

Responsibilities:
- Gathering information from diverse sources
- Evaluating source quality and relevance
- Creating comprehensive synthesis of findings
- Maintaining clear source attribution

### 3. Architect Agent
**Primary Role:** Research framework design

Responsibilities:
- Designing analytical frameworks
- Establishing research boundaries
- Defining key metrics and dimensions
- Creating conceptual models

### 4. Debug Agent
**Primary Role:** Verification and gap analysis

Responsibilities:
- Identifying logical inconsistencies
- Finding information gaps
- Testing assumptions
- Detecting potential biases

### 5. Ask Agent
**Primary Role:** Focused information retrieval

Responsibilities:
- Formulating precise queries
- Retrieving specific information
- Validating factual claims

## Implementation: MCP Servers as Your Research Infrastructure

What truly transforms this approach is implementing it through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:

### Core MCP Servers

1. **logic-mcp-primitives**: Provides the fundamental cognitive operations
   - Example: `observe`, `define`, `infer`, `synthesize`

2. **brave-search**: External information retrieval
   - Example: `brave_web_search`, `brave_local_search`

3. **perplexity**: Enhanced search capabilities
   - Example: `search`, `fact_check` 

4. **arxiv-mcp**: Academic paper access
   - Example: `search_papers`, `get_paper_content`

5. **context7**: Documentation lookup
   - Example: `get-library-docs`

### Integration Workflow

1. **Data Collection Phase**
   - Logic primitives define information needs
   - Specialized MCP servers retrieve relevant data
   - Results are stored with source attribution

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Logic primitives process the collected data
   - Each step is documented with confidence levels
   - Reasoning chains are preserved

3. **Synthesis Phase**
   - Multiple sources are integrated with traceability
   - Conflicting information is explicitly reconciled
   - Final analysis maintains links to original sources

## Process Patterns: Research Recipes for Common Tasks

These pre-defined patterns combine primitives for specific research needs:

### 1. Signal → Concept
**Chain:** `Observe → Distinguish → Define`
**Use for:** Understanding new domains, creating taxonomies, establishing terminology

### 2. Trend Lens
**Chain:** `Observe → Sequence → Compare → Infer`
**Use for:** Detecting patterns in time-series data, market shifts, behavior changes

### 3. Causal Map
**Chain:** `Observe → Sequence → Infer → Synthesize`
**Use for:** Explaining complex events, building narrative explanations

### 4. Decision Sprint
**Chain:** `Observe → Compare → Infer → Decide`
**Use for:** Quick decision making, crisis response, rapid evaluation

### 5. Hypothesis Loop
**Chain:** `Observe → Ask → Infer → Reflect → Adapt`
**Use for:** Scientific testing, validating assumptions, iterative refinement

## Enforcing Research Discipline: Directory Structure

Implement this organizational structure to enforce good research practices:

```
/projects/research_[topic]/
├── raw/                 # Raw research outputs
│   ├── observations/    # Uninterpreted data
│   └── sources/         # Original sources
├── analysis/            # Intermediate analysis
│   ├── frameworks/      # Defined concepts and structures
│   ├── comparisons/     # Evaluations and distinctions
│   └── inferences/      # Derived conclusions
├── synthesis/           # Integrated analyses
│   ├── initial_draft/   # First comprehensive synthesis
│   └── review_notes/    # Reflection artifacts
├── final/               # Polished deliverables
├── .roo/                # Process tracking
│   ├── logs/            # Activity logs by mode
│   └── boomerang-state.json # Task tracking
└── README.md            # Project overview
```

## Implementing Boomerang Logic: The Secret to Effective Delegation

The "boomerang logic" pattern ensures accountability:

1. **Task Origination**: Orchestrator creates a subtask with clear parameters
2. **Specialist Processing**: The appropriate agent completes the task
3. **Return**: Results come back to the orchestrator with metadata
4. **Verification**: Quality is checked against requirements
5. **Integration**: The verified component joins the larger research

Example task assignment:
```json
{
  "task_id": "market_analysis_001",
  "origin_mode": "Orchestrator",
  "destination_mode": "Research",
  "parameters": {
    "topic": "Quantum computing market adoption",
    "timeframe": "2025-2030",
    "required_outputs": [
      "Industry sector breakdown",
      "Adoption barriers analysis",
      "Market size projections"
    ]
  }
}
```

Example return payload:
```json
{
  "task_id": "market_analysis_001",
  "origin_mode": "Research",
  "destination_mode": "Orchestrator", 
  "status": "complete",
  "result": "Completed analysis in research/quantum_market_analysis.md",
  "metadata": {
    "sources": 12,
    "confidence_level": "medium-high",
    "completion_time": "2025-04-29T09:15:32Z"
  }
}
```
