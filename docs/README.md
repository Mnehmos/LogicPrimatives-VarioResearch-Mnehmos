## The LogicPrimitives Framework

LogicPrimitives is a conceptual framework for creating AI research agents that produce transparent, traceable, and reliable results by breaking complex analysis into primitive cognitive operations:

```
observe → define → distinguish → infer → reflect → synthesize → decide → adapt
```

This approach moves beyond the limitations of mainstream AI tools by:

1. **Breaking down complexity** into distinct cognitive steps
2. **Documenting each step** as a separate research artifact
3. **Maintaining full traceability** from raw data to conclusions
4. **Exposing assumptions and biases** through structured reflection
5. **Creating confidence-calibrated conclusions** with explicit uncertainty levels

## Using This Documentation

Start with the [Complete Guide](guide.md) for a comprehensive understanding of the LogicPrimitives framework. Then explore the specialized documents based on your interests:

- For team collaboration aspects, see [Multi-Agent Architecture](multi-agent-architecture.md)
- For technical integration details, see [MCP Server Integration](mcp-server-integration.md)
- For common workflow patterns, see [Process Patterns](process-patterns.md)
- For practical implementation approaches, see [Real-World Application](real_world_application.md)

## See It In Action

To see LogicPrimitives in action, explore the [demo directory](../demo/) which contains a complete demonstration analyzing how AI might impact democratic elections in 2026.

The demo walks through each primitive operation:

1. [Observe](../demo/1-observe.md): Raw data collection
2. [Define](../demo/2-define.md): Framework establishment
3. [Distinguish](../demo/3-distinguish.md): Categorical differentiation
4. [Infer](../demo/4-infer.md): Evidence-based projection
5. [Reflect](../demo/5-reflect.md): Critical process evaluation
6. [Synthesize](../demo/6-synthesize.md): Comprehensive integration
