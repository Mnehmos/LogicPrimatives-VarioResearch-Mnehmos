# Beyond Spreadsheets: Logic Primitives & MCP Servers for Transparent Financial Analysis [r/FP&A]

While we can all agree financial analysis tools aren't where they need to be yet (Excel is great but has limitations), I wanted to share a framework that's dramatically improved my FP&A process: **Logic Primitives with MCP servers**.

## The Problem with Current Financial Analysis Tools

Most of us have hit these frustrations:

* **Financial models** become black boxes that only their creators understand
* **Data sources** are often disconnected or require manual integration
* **Assumptions** get buried in complicated spreadsheet logic
* **Analysis processes** are difficult to audit or reproduce
* **Confidence levels** in projections aren't explicit or quantified

## Logic Primitives: Breaking Financial Analysis into Cognitive Building Blocks

The key innovation: treating financial analysis as a series of **distinct cognitive operations** rather than one monolithic process.

```
observe → define → distinguish → infer → reflect → synthesize → decide → adapt
```

Each step:
1. Uses a specialized prompt template
2. Produces a documented artifact with metadata
3. Makes reasoning and assumptions explicit and auditable

## How Logic Primitives Transform Financial Analysis

**Traditional approach:**
```
Analyst: "Forecast our cash flow for Q3-Q4 2025 based on current trends"

[Complex Excel model with hidden assumptions]

Output: "Cash flow projected at $4.2M for Q3, $4.8M for Q4"
[With buried assumptions and opaque reasoning]
```

**With Logic Primitives:**
1. **Observe**: Collect raw financial data without interpretation
   ```
   Q1 2025 Revenue: $15.2M (Source: Financial Report)
   Q1 2025 Operating Expenses: $12.1M (Source: General Ledger)
   Average DSO: 48 days (Source: AR Aging Report)
   ...
   ```

2. **Define**: Create explicit framework with clear dimensions
   ```
   Cash Flow Framework:
   - Collection Efficiency: Measured by DSO trends
   - Expense Timing: Categorized by fixed/variable components
   - Seasonality Factors: Based on 3-year historical patterns
   - Market Risk Factors: Identified from economic indicators
   ```

3. **Distinguish**: Categorize components by impact and reliability
   ```
   High Reliability Components:
   - Fixed expenses (confidence: high, historical variance <2%)
   - Contracted revenue (confidence: high, legally binding)
   
   Variable Components:
   - New product revenue (confidence: medium, based on early indicators)
   - Marketing ROI (confidence: low, new channels being tested)
   ```

4. **Infer**: Generate projections with explicit confidence ratings
   ```
   Q3 Cash Inflow: $16.8M ± $1.2M
   - Core business: $14.5M (confidence: high)
   - New initiatives: $2.3M (confidence: medium)
   
   Q3 Cash Outflow: $12.9M ± $0.7M
   - Fixed costs: $9.3M (confidence: high)
   - Variable costs: $3.6M (confidence: medium)
   ```

5. **Reflect**: Evaluate methodological limitations
   ```
   Key Uncertainties:
   - Potential recession indicators not fully incorporated
   - Limited data on new market expansion
   - Competitor pricing strategy changes not modeled
   ```

6. **Synthesize**: Integrate findings with clear traceability
   ```
   Final Cash Flow Projection:
   - Q3: $4.2M ± $0.8M (confidence: medium-high)
   - Q4: $4.8M ± $1.2M (confidence: medium)
   
   Key Insights:
   1. Working capital efficiency improvement driving Q4 increase
   2. New product line contributing ~18% of Q4 growth
   3. Risk of 20% downside if key assumptions not met
   ```

## Implementing with MCP Servers (The Technical Part)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers are the infrastructure that makes this possible:

1. **logic-mcp-primitives**: Core thinking operations
   - `observe`, `define`, `infer`, etc.

2. **Financial data servers**:
   - `alphavantage-mcp`: Stock and market data
   - `edgar-mcp`: SEC filings and financial statements
   - `economic-indicators-mcp`: Macroeconomic data

3. **Analysis servers**:
   - `financial-modeling-mcp`: Ratio analysis and projections
   - `risk-analysis-mcp`: Monte Carlo simulations and stress testing

## Getting Started Without Complex Technical Setup

You don't need to be a developer to start using this approach:

1. **Structural implementation with markdown files:**
   - Create a directory structure for your analysis:
   ```
   /financial_analysis/
   ├── raw/observations/       # Raw data collected
   ├── analysis/frameworks/    # Your defined frameworks
   ├── analysis/inferences/    # Your reasoning steps
   └── synthesis/              # Final integration
   ```

2. **Start with basic templates:**
   - For financial observations:
   ```markdown
   # OBSERVE: [Financial Topic]
   
   ## Raw Financial Data
   1. [Data point 1]
      - Source: [Data source with date]
      - Confidence: [Confidence level]
   2. [Data point 2]
      ...
   
   ## Metadata
   - Observation ID: obs_[unique_id]
   - Context ID: [analysis_context]
   - Timestamp: [date_time]
   ```

3. **Implement process patterns for common FP&A tasks:**
   - **Variance analysis**: observe → distinguish → compare → infer
   - **Scenario planning**: define → infer → adapt
   - **Investment decision**: observe → compare → synthesize → decide

## Basic Implementation (No Server Required)

Even without setting up MCP servers, you can start using this approach in your daily work:

1. Create template documents for each primitive
2. Document each step of your analysis process explicitly
3. Maintain clear source attribution and confidence levels
4. Use the file structure to enforce methodological discipline

## For Those Who Want Technical Implementation

If your team has technical resources:

1. Set up a basic server with:
   ```bash
   mkdir financial-analysis-mcp
   cd financial-analysis-mcp
   npm init -y
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk @google/generative-ai sqlite
   ```

2. Connect to financial data sources:
   ```javascript
   // Example connector for Alpha Vantage
   async function getFinancialStatements(symbol) {
     const response = await axios.get(
       `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=INCOME_STATEMENT&symbol=${symbol}&apikey=${API_KEY}`
     );
     return response.data;
   }
   ```

3. Create handlers for automated financial analysis

## Why This Beats Traditional Financial Analysis

* **Traceable reasoning chains** from data to conclusions
* **Variable confidence levels** based on data quality and assumptions
* **Explicit frameworks** that stay consistent across analyses
* **Assumption identification** through reflection steps
* **Reproducible methodology** through structured artifacts
* **Version control** for financial models and logic

## Where to Learn More

I've found the [LogicPrimitives repository](https://github.com/Mnehmos/LogicPrimatives-VarioResearch-Mnehmos) helpful in setting this up - it has conceptual guides and documentation (though not installable software yet).

For finance-specific implementations, I've been adapting the general framework to FP&A needs.

Has anyone else experimented with structured reasoning frameworks for financial analysis? How are you dealing with the limitations of current tools like Excel and BI platforms?
