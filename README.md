**LogicPrimitives** is a conceptual framework for creating AI research agents that produce transparent, traceable, and reliable results by breaking complex analysis into primitive cognitive operations. This approach dramatically outperforms one-shot generations used by mainstream AI tools.

> **Note**: This repository contains conceptual guides and documentation only, not installable software.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Implementation Disclaimer

LogicPrimitives was originally developed as a custom MCP server, but that implementation is not release-ready as it was an initial version with API key management issues. There are two main approaches to implement this framework:

1. **Build your own Logic MCP primitive**: Create a server that calls models outside the chat to make these decisions in isolation, providing a cleaner separation of cognitive operations.

2. **Document each primitive in Markdown**: Use sequential .md files to document each primitive step, allowing for structured thinking that can be traced and verified.

The demonstration in this repository uses the Markdown approach to show the concept in action.

## üîç The Problem with Traditional AI Research

Standard AI tools like Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, or Brave typically:
- Generate conclusions without showing intermediate reasoning
- Produce inconsistent outputs with each run
- Create phantom citations without proper evidence
- Deliver uniform confidence across all conclusions
- Cannot identify their own biases and limitations

## üí° Our Solution: Logic Primitives with MCP Servers

LogicPrimitives breaks research into modular cognitive operations:

```
observe ‚Üí define ‚Üí distinguish ‚Üí infer ‚Üí reflect ‚Üí synthesize ‚Üí decide ‚Üí adapt
```

Each operation produces a separate, verifiable research artifact connected through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and specialized agent roles.

## üß© Core Components

### 1. Logic Primitives Library

- **observe**: Collect raw data without interpretation
- **define**: Establish frameworks, categories, and boundaries
- **distinguish**: Identify differences and classify information
- **infer**: Generate conclusions with explicit confidence levels
- **reflect**: Critically evaluate the analysis process
- **synthesize**: Integrate all components into a coherent whole
- **decide**: Make clear choices based on analysis
- **adapt**: Modify approaches based on new information

### 2. Multi-Agent Framework

- **Orchestrator**: Task decomposition & coordination
- **Research Agent**: Information gathering & synthesis
- **Architect Agent**: Framework design
- **Debug Agent**: Verification & gap analysis
- **Ask Agent**: Focused information retrieval
- **Code Agent**: Technical implementation

### 3. Boomerang Logic & Task Tracking

Every task:
1. Originates from the Orchestrator with clear parameters
2. Gets processed by a specialist agent
3. Returns results in a standardized format to the Orchestrator

### 4. MCP Server Integration

- **logic-mcp-primitives**: Core thinking operations
- **computer-use-primitives**: File operations and storage
- **brave-search**: External information retrieval
- **context7**: Documentation lookup
- **perplexity**: Enhanced search capabilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Research Disclaimer

The example research in this repository is demonstrative only and not synthesized from actual sources. In real research applications, tools like Brave Search, Perplexity, arXiv, and Alpha Vantage work in tandem to create sources from raw data.

The LogicPrimitives approach addresses not just the challenge of documenting sources, but documenting the chain of thought and second-order reasoning to move beyond black box reports.
