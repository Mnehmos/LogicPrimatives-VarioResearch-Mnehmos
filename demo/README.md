# AI Election Impact Demo: Logic Primitives in Action

This demonstration shows LogicPrimitives in action by analyzing how AI might impact democratic elections in 2026. Each file represents one step in the complete cognitive workflow.

## Complete Cognitive Workflow

### 1. [Observe](./1-observe.md)
**Raw data collection** about AI technologies impacting elections, without interpretation. This primitive separates pure observation from analysis.

### 2. [Define](./2-define.md)
**Framework definition** establishing clear analytical axes and boundaries for the research. This provides the conceptual structure for all subsequent analysis.

### 3. [Distinguish](./3-distinguish.md)
**Categorical differentiation** between electoral threats and safeguards, examining their characteristics, deployment patterns, and technical mechanisms.

### 4. [Infer](./4-infer.md)
**Evidence-based projection** of AI impacts on elections with explicit confidence levels and counterfactual analysis. Shows clear reasoning chains from evidence to conclusions.

### 5. [Reflect](./5-reflect.md)
**Critical evaluation** of the research process itself, identifying methodological limitations, assumptions, biases, and refinement priorities.

### 6. [Synthesize](./6-synthesize.md)
**Comprehensive integration** of all previous steps into a coherent analysis with strategic recommendations and confidence assessments.

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

This demonstration shows several key advantages of the LogicPrimitives approach:

1. **Traceable Reasoning**: Every conclusion in step 6 can be traced back through the preceding steps to its evidential foundation.

2. **Explicit Confidence Levels**: Different aspects of the analysis have different confidence assessments, rather than uniform certainty.

3. **Bias Identification**: The reflect step explicitly surfaces potential biases and assumptions in the analysis.

4. **Methodological Transparency**: The entire cognitive process is visible and can be critiqued at each stage.

5. **Structured Knowledge**: Information is organized consistently using a defined framework rather than ad hoc analysis.

## How to Use This Demo

1. Follow the files in numerical order to see how the cognitive process builds
2. Compare the initial observation in step 1 with the final synthesis in step 6
3. Examine how the reflect step (5) influences the final synthesis
4. Note how alternative scenarios and counterfactuals are explicitly considered
5. Observe how confidence levels are calibrated throughout the process

This demonstration shows how LogicPrimitives produces more reliable, transparent research than one-shot generation from standard AI tools.
